# 🏥 MediTriage AI

**Real-Time Emergency Room Triage Optimization System**

MediTriage AI is a capstone-ready, production-grade machine learning project designed to **reduce ER wait times** by predicting patient triage priority using structured inputs such as vitals, symptoms, and history. Built in Python and Java, it includes Snowflake-powered data pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration, Docker containers, and CI/CD support.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- 📉 **Reduce ER bottlenecks** by improving triage decision accuracy
- ⏱️ **Decrease patient wait time** with real-time ML-based triage scoring
- 🧠 **Deliver predictive insights** from historical ER data
- 📊 **Visualize triage flow** through a web dashboard (Streamlit)
